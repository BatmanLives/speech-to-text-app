## Since Railway needs GitHub, here's the ACTUAL easiest way:

### OPTION 1: Upload to GitHub First (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `speech-to-text-app`
3. Select "Public"
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Click "uploading an existing file"
6. Drag all files from this folder
7. Click "Commit changes"

**THEN:**

8. Go to: https://railway.app
9. Click "Start a New Project"
10. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
11. Select your repository
12. Click "Deploy"
13. Wait 2 minutes
14. Click "Generate Domain" 
15. Get your URL!

### OPTION 2: Use Render (Even Easier - No GitHub Needed!)

Actually, let me create a BETTER option for you...

I'll create a version that uses **Glitch** - you can deploy by just uploading files, no GitHub, no API keys, nothing!

---

## 🎯 ABSOLUTE EASIEST: Use Glitch

1. Go to: https://glitch.com
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub" (or create account)
3. Click "New Project" → "Import from GitHub"
4. Paste: [I'll create this]

Actually, you know what - let me create a version that runs COMPLETELY CLIENT-SIDE with no server needed at all. That way you can just open an HTML file and host it anywhere!

Would that work better?
