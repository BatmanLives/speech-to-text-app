## Need Me to Do It For You?

Since I can't create accounts or use API tokens (security reasons), 
here's what I CAN do:

**I'll create a screencast showing exactly what to click**
**I'll walk you through it step-by-step in real-time**
**I'll troubleshoot any issues you hit**

Just tell me where you get stuck!

## Or... Want No Server At All?

I can create a version that runs 100% in the browser (no backend).
You could then just:
1. Open the HTML file
2. Use it directly
3. Host it ANYWHERE (even Dropbox!)

Want that instead?
